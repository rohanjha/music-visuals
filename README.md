# MusicVisWetherbeeJha

This project was inspired by seeing lots of lots of uninspiring music visuals. We found that many visuals were either preprogrammed - which is expensive and limits the extent to which a set can change - or were static and didn't respond to the music - which isn't very fun.

The goal of this project was to create visuals that respond to music. We used the Processing language and its built-in Music API. At the moment, our visuals respond mostly to spikes in the amplitude of frequency buckets. We experimented with using tempo or vocals but are still working on it. However, we found that we were still able to create really engaging and powerful visuals based on a couple functions we created to do statistical work with information about the relative amplitude of different frequency buckets.

A couple visuals are quickly discussed below:

1. Jamiexx: Assigns each triangle in the art for SeeSaw (Club Version) to a bucket of frequencies. The color of the triangle varies based on the amplitude of the frequency bucket.

2. Diff_Eq: Particles spiral out from the center of the screen. The color and number of the particles vary based on the bass.

3. Demon_Trap: Spooky and evocative gifs are triggered by bass patterns.

4. Fractal_Squares: Experiments with Processing's 3D libraries.

A couple others too - hope you'll check it out.
